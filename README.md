Sleep Until
===========

A python script that will not exit until the desired time.

This utility likely already exists in some form, but Googling for it was taking
longer than making it from scratch, and less fun.

Sample Use
===========
```bash
~$ sleep_until 9:25; say "Meeting in 4 hours and 5 minutes"
```
or
```bash
~$ sleep_until 13:25:30; say "Meeting in 4 and a half minutes"
```
